Wei is a cross-platform automation management tool designed to simplify and automate the installation, deployment, and management of software. Whether it's open-source software on GitHub, custom software, or third-party applications, Wei provides powerful functionality. Importantly, Wei can handle systems of any scale, from individual devices to large-scale clusters.
